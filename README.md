myWebsite

Built using React, it leverages the starter code from "Create React App" to give me some special scripts I did not want to set up myself. 

Uses Firebase for hosting, this is mostly to allow me to roll back changes and because I don't want to pay for hosting anymore.

I would suggest looking at the code in App.jsx as a good starting point to reading my code.
